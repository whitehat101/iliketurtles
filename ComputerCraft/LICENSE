I authorise and encourage people to create and distribute lua programs for ComputerCraft however they see fit (try the forums at computercraft.info!). I also give permission for ComputerCraft to be included in any and all mod packs, provided that the ComputerCraft files are included completely unmodified. If you include ComputerCraft in a popular modpack, please consider donating to the development of the mod.
